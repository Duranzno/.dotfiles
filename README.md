> Cross-platform dotfiles & developer environment for Ubuntu 20.04+ based on [jthegedus dotfiles](https://github.com/jthegedus/dotfiles)

### Preamble

<details>
<Summary>

As this is based on the [jthegedus dotfiles](https://github.com/jthegedus/dotfiles), but modified for dotfiles support it should be "cross-platform" because as they put it:"

</Summary>
This "cross-platform" setup of mine is really just a Ubuntu 20.04+ ZSH environment. Homebrew is used on both Ubuntu and macOS where possible. Windows 10 is supported with Ubuntu 20.04+ via WSL 2 👌
